						<p>Technically all that stellation is, is the new polyhedron formed by the intersection of it's faces after you expand them. Maybe that still sounds intimidating or unintuitive, it might be easier to visualize in two dimensions; if you look at a pentagon and extend it's edges(instead of it's faces) you see that they will eventually cross, all these crossings form a pentagram(shown below). You can keep extending the edges but they will never intersect again(when you move to 3d polyhedra or even just polygons with more sides there will be multiple crossings and thus multiple possible stellations).</p>

								<td><p>Now for an example in three dimensions it's easiest to look at the octahedron(left). So first things first by our definition before we expand the faces. Small note but just like in 2d you don't deform the rest of the polyhedron(like the image on the left bellow). For these visual demonstrations I initially don't expand the faces the amount they need to fully meet as it makes it far to difficult to see things but in reality you can extend the face into an infinite plane. As a result you don't need to worry about the shape of the initial face, just the plane that it's in.</p></td>

						<img src="/images/stellation/top_extended_octahedron.png" alt="/images/where.png" style="width:49%">
						<p>Now remember we're looking for intersections between faces so let's look at the different kinds of faces and how they interact roughly one by one. Different kinds of faces not meaning different polygons as the faces are the same(the octahedron is a platonic solid after all) so let's expand the top face and look at the other faces in regard to that and then we can apply what we learn from there to all of the other faces. First things first there's a face directly opposite to the top face that is parallel so we know that one will never intersect with our face. That leaves two categories of faces here, the 3 faces connected to the edges(left bellow)and the ones that share vertices(right bellow).</p>

						<p> then think about where the other faces intersect as a line on that plane that you can extend as much as we need(this is the same as expanding the face but it's much easier to think about and visualize.). The faces along the edges of our chosen triangle expand out and never intersect with each other like if you atempted to stellate a triangle, the faces that you could think of as on the next "lower level(or ring(neither very relevant here but again you'll see this same concept in later polyhedra))"(or as the ones that share a vertex but not an edge with the chosen triangle) will extend lines perpendicular to the vertices of the original face which transcribes another triangle to make something akin to the triforce or a simple sierpinski triangle. These are all of the intersections for the octahedron as the final face is paralel to our starting face and all of the lines we've drawn are actively extending away from wach other or are parallel. So this shows where all of the faces intersect each other and there's only one "sections of pockets"(I guess is how you would put it) and so if you made the large triangle a new solid face on every face of the octahedron(because doing this process on every face yields the same result) you get a new polyhedron called(you're never gonna guess this) the stellated octahedron(or the stella octangula which you might not have guessed.). The resulting diagram is known as a polyhedrons stellation diagram and it's realistically the only way that you can discover all of the possible stellations for a polyhedron without your brain exploding after staring at dice for hours(totally not speaking from experience/s). For polyhedra with more than one kind of face there needs to be a different diagram for each face which makes things more complicated so as far as examples go for now I'll be using</p>
