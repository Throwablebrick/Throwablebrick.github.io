					<p>Generally speaking this wiki will be subdivided into categories that will mostly be my various interests/hyperfixations. This won't be perfect as I won't be making whole new categories for certain individual pages and so I'll equally document ones outside of that in a misc section at the bottom or perhaps eventually it's own page.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This page will give the broad strokes of each of the main categories as a sort of reading guide. Each category will also have it's own in depth reading guide that will be linked to from the headers that start each section.</p>

							<h1>To be written</h1>
						</summary>
						<p>because I haven't written anything yet all of the sections are to be written but here's what you can expect as I make more content</p>

							<summary>
								<h2>Polytopes</h2>
							</summary>
							<p>You likely know what a polygon is but probably not a polyhedron, polychoron, etc. Put simply polygons(2d) are shapes made of lines, polyhedra(3d) are shapes made of polygons, and polychora(4d) are just shapes made of polyhedra. So polytopes is just the word used to refer to shapes regardless of the dimension.</p>
							<p>pages will be added as I make them</p>

								<h2>Insects</h2>
							</summary>
							<p>People are often aware of how spiders aren't insects "because they have 8 legs" but that reason is more so a side effect of the simple fact that they come from different evolutionary lines. The difference is better understood when you understand taxonomy.</p>
