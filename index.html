					<p>Hi, this is my website. I thought it would be a really fun way to do just about anything online in a way that I have complete controll over how things are run and look; all while having full ownership of it all. I'm used to writing things in the style of a wiki so there will definitely be sections of this that are in that style given that I like to talk a lot about random things that interest me, so it will be nice to have an outlet for that. It can also serve double duty as something that I can refer people to if they want to know more about something that i'm talking about or if i'm not currently explaining it very well I can easily find all the visuals I need along with a more cohesive explanation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I'll probaly also favor posting most things here instead of on social media because I don't want to be dependent on that and ultimately I can make all the same kinds of posts and more on here and it's much more personal and cool anyways.</p>
